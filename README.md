# Enigma

This is a mock Enigma Machine I am working on to brush up a bit on coding before heading back to
school this fall. To operate the program, simply type your message in the text field on the left 
hand side and the message will encrypt live as you type it on the right. As you type you may notice
the 'lightboard' below the message will light up, this is to mimic how the Enigma Machine actually
functions, whatever the last key you hit, the corrosponding encrypted key will light up.
You may also notice that some of the keys on the lightboard are in the wrong positions, again this
is to mimic the design of the Enigma Machine.

In order to un-encrypt your message all you have to do is paste/type the encrypted message back into
the text field on the left. Please note that you will also need to ensure that the settings below the
lightboard need to be exactly as they were when the original message was encoded, or you will just
further scramble the message. I have included a copy button that copies the current settings to your
clipboard to make sharing settings easier.

One final note is that this has not been tested for mobile, I make no claims on its functionality for
mobile and for best experience, you should use a desktop running a modern browser.
